<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The abilities and knowledge of each student are evaluated during his studies with grades
or percentages that tell us how good the student is in the study. This evaluation gives us the
GPA and according to it we consider students to be good, bad, talented or lazy. Students’
learning outcomes and achievements during their university studies can be influenced by
many factors, such as learning patterns, talents, interpersonal relationships, motivation and
many others. The student’s results can subsequently affect life after graduation and can even
help with finding a job. However, it is not always important what academic results the student
has achieved during their studies, and for many employers, the experience and what they can
do is much more important. Not surprisingly, many people with a worse academic result or
without a university degree are very successful in their lives.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The SAT is a test widely used for college admission in USA. People think that students that achieve high score in SAT, have also the highest GPA during college. In this competition we want to predict the average GPA cumulated by a student in the college, based only on the scores that he/she achieved in SAT.
You are given a training dataset, in which each row contain the student ID, SAT score and average GPA cumulated during college. Use this dataset for training your model and then test your model using test dataset. Each row of test dataset contain student ID and SAT score. Finally you should submit a CSV file, that contains the student ID , and predicted GPA score for each row of the test dataset.</p>
